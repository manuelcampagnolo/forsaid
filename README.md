Goal: discrimination of spectral signatures (hyperspectral data)

Steps:
1. Pre-processing: define groups of bands which are highly correlated, i.e. absolute correlation values higher than R, for  agiven R
2. Processing: LDA over the groups defined above

This are tested with the data provided by Miguel Landum
